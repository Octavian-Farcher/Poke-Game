This was an guided react project, actually it was my first react project to learn better the using of props. It contains 3 components Pokecard,Pokedex and Pokegame. The first of the 3 components generates the template of a single pokecard and is imported into Pokedex. The second component, Pokedex, is using the Pokecard component and displays a full hand of cards. The third and last component is the one that has all the cards props in a constant and randomly places them in two hands. Pokegame also calculates the experience of each hand that will later be compared to see which is the winner hand.
